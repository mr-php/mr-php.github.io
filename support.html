        <h3>Technical Support</h3>

        <ul>
            <li>Technical Consulting</li>
            <li>Programming and Application Development</li>
            <li>Server Management and Database Administration</li>
            <li>System Support and Training</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Hourly Rates</h3>

        <p>Our basic pricing for support/consulting is simple and public. While you can request our assistance on an
            ad-hoc basis, we value building an ongoing relationship. If you commit to a number of hours per month, we
            can resource appropriately and assist more effectively since we'll be in-the-know about your infrastructure
            already; and you will note that it's also cheaper.</p>

        <p>Pricing is calculated based on actual time worked in 1 minute blocks, charged at the amount agreed when
            payment was accepted. The price will never exceed the agreed hours without client authorisation.</p>

        <p>Emergency availability is charged at $200/hr for business hours, $300/hr for all other hours, and is not
            guaranteed for non-subscription clients.</p>
